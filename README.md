# Codechallenge2
This is my week two code challenge repository. In this repository you will find a couple of files, 9 files to be exact. There are 4 html files, 3 Javascript files, one readme file and one package-lock file. The index.html file is the main file which leads to other html pages.
# description
This project contains 3 solutions. One of them is a swapp case solution that swaps the cases of letters in a string, the second solution is a function creating a new array using two numbers as inputs and the third solution is a function that extracts prime numbers from an array of numbers.Each of this functions is capable of displaying it's result as a string through an alert window. To view the array itself one will have to view the console.
# project setup
The project has an index.html file which is linked to the other html files(foxsolution.html, newarray.html and primenumbers.html). Each of the linked pages is opened in a new window and has an input prompt with instructions to the user to input the needed data. Once the needed data is inputted the result is automatically returned as a string through the alert window and as an array in the console.
